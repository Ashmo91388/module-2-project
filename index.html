    Below are examples of things I've built as well as collobarted on.
    The ask for my "Dev Portfolio" was to create a email form via html. The deployed version can be found on my GitHub account listed as "22-stu-mini-project-AM".
    I have also included an app I've collobarted on called "What day is it?". This app was built for clients who are looking for specific workouts. The app allows you to select specific criteria wether
    it be the muscle group, type of workout as well as duration. My major role in this collaboration was to implement the client-side storage, in which the client can track their daily weight wuth their 
    desired goal weight. Although this is still in progress for a more polished look, the local storage provides the stored data in the applications console.
